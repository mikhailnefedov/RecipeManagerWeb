!The development is currently paused. Reason: Non existing knowledge on frontend development leads to suffering for the developer --> He needs to read some books and tutorials.
After that the development can continue


## What is the purpose of RecipeManagerWeb?

[Java and JavaFX](https://github.com/mikhailnefedov/RecipeManager), I settled on this project using ASP.NET and React. 

## Functionality:
